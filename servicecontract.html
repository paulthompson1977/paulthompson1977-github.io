            <h2 class="content-subhead">Service Contract Advantages</h2>
            <p>
			     A maintenance contract gives you peace of mind, keeps your costs under control and a fast response time.  If you have any problems with your equipment, a quick  phone call and we can come and repair your appliance, and your business can keep on making money. We repair all the major brands including Blue Seal, Falcon, Hobart, Lincat,  Moorwood Vulcan and Rational.  We can service combi-ovens, dishwashers, glasswashers, grills, mixers and ovens. We work at all kinds of premises such as Bars, Cafes, Community Centres, Hospitals, Hotels, Pubs, Restaurants and Schools. 
			 </p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead">Maintenance Contract Types</h2>
            <p>
			     We offer three types of contracts:
			 </p>
<ul>
  <li type="square">Inspection & Gas Safety Check</li>
  <li type="square">Parts, Inspection, and Check </li>

  <li type="square">Fully Comprehensive</li>
</ul>
<p>			 
An inspection contract includes an annual inspection of all your kitchen appliances, with recommendations to keep your equipment in the best condition. It also includes an annual gas safety check and certificate to keep your business legal and insured.
</p>	
	
<p>			 
A parts contract includes all of the above, and covers the costs of any parts required during the year.
</p>	
<p>			 
A fully comprehensive contract guarantees that all of your equipment is fully working, all the costs of parts and labour are covered by your monthly contract payment.  This gives you a fixed and predictable amount to pay each month.
</p>

			            <h2 class="content-subhead">CRB/DBS Approval </h2>
            <p> Many premises such as schools and hospitals require the workers to have a CRB/DBS Approval from the police.  All of our engineers are approved to work around children in education or healthcare. They each have completed a CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check, which is now also known as a DBS check.
